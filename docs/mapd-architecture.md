# Memory Allocation Problem Detector (mapd) â€“ System Architecture

## Project Goal

Design a dynamic memory problem detector for Linux user-space processes that can detect:

- Memory **leaks** *(via injection)*
- **Dangling pointers** (use-after-free) *(via injection)*
- **Buffer overflows** *(via injection)*
- **Memory fragmentation** *(via system observation)*
- General memory usage trends *(via /proc monitoring)*
- Optional: **real-time GUI notifications**

---

## High-Level Architecture Overview

The system is composed of two main components:

1. **Injected Memory Wrapper (for injectable targets)**  
   - Injected using `LD_PRELOAD` (for C/C++ programs)
   - Intercepts `malloc`, `free`, `calloc`, `realloc`
   - Sends detailed memory events to a central analyzer

2. **System-Wide Analyzer Process**  
   - A persistent background process
   - Monitors general memory usage of **any user-space process**
   - Aggregates system metrics and tracks injected program events

## Communication Flow

```text
[ C/C++ Program (injected) ] ---+
                                |
[ Other user processes ] ------>+--> [ Analyzer Process ]
                                |         |-- Thread: Buddyinfo monitor
                                |         |-- Thread: /proc scanner
                                |         |-- Thread: GUI notifications
                                |         |-- Thread: Event listener (injected programs)
                                |         |-- Central database and reporter
```

## Components and Responsibilities

### 1. Injected Memory Wrapper (`libmemwrap.so`)

- Loaded via `LD_PRELOAD` into supported programs
- Tracks memory function calls and memory metadata
- Detects:
  - **Leaks**
  - **Dangling pointers**
  - **Buffer overflows**
- Communicates with analyzer over UNIX domain sockets (not clear yet if sockets will be used)

---

### 2. Central Analyzer Process

Handles both injected and non-injected processes:

**Main Threads:**

| Thread Name       | Function                                                              |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Buddyinfo Monitor | Monitors kernel-level fragmentation via `/proc/buddyinfo`            |
| /proc Monitor     | Scans `/proc/[pid]/status`, `/maps`, `/smaps` for memory metrics     |
| GUI Thread        | Displays notifications (e.g., `notify-send`, GTK, Qt)                |
| Event Listener    | Receives live memory events from wrappers (one thread per program)   |
| Data Aggregator   | Logs, aggregates, reports system-wide memory behaviour               |

---

## Detection Capabilities Matrix

| Issue                         | Detectable Without Injection | Requires Injection |
|------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------|
| Memory leaks                 | No                         | Yes             |
| Dangling pointers            | No                         | Yes             |
| Buffer overflows             | No                         | Yes             |
| Double frees                 | No                         | Yes             |
| Memory fragmentation         | Yes (via `/proc/buddyinfo`) | No              |
| Overall heap/memory usage    | Yes (via `/proc`)          | No              |

## IPC Protocol (Wrapper <-> Analyzer)

- **Protocol**: Custom message format (e.g. CSV, JSON, ...)
- **Transport**: UNIX domain sockets (maybe other, domain sockets are recommended by a lot of sources)
- **Events**:
  - `malloc size=64 addr=0x1234`
  - `free addr=0x1234`
  - `overflow detected at addr=0x5678`
  - `leak summary on exit`

---

## Optional Enhancements
(really only optional)
- Process filtering
- Time-based memory graphs
- Memory pressure alerts
- Global or per-process stats export (JSON, CSV)

##  Benefits of This Architecture
(collected by ChatGPT)

-  **Hybrid**: supports both injected and non-injected processes
-  **Modular**: clear separation of tracking and analysis
-  **Efficient**: no per-process analyzers needed
-  **Insightful**: captures both correctness and usage patterns
-  **Extendable**: supports GUI, time-series data, and summary exports
